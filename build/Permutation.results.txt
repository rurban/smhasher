--- Testing beamsplitter "A hash made only with S-boxes" POOR

[[[ Keyset 'Permutation' Tests ]]]

Combination Lowbits Tests:
Keyset 'Combination' - up to 7 blocks from a set of 8 - 2396744 keys
Testing collisions ( 64-bit) - Expected    0.0, actual      0 (0.00x)
Testing collisions (high 32-bit) - Expected       1337.5, actual    676 (0.51x)
Testing collisions (high 25-38 bits) - Worst is 32 bits: 676/1337 (0.51x)
Testing collisions (high 12-bit) - Expected    2396744.0, actual 2392648 (1.00x) (-4096)
Testing collisions (high  8-bit) - Expected    2396744.0, actual 2396488 (1.00x) (-256)
Testing collisions (low  32-bit) - Expected       1337.5, actual    716 (0.54x)
Testing collisions (low  25-38 bits) - Worst is 34 bits: 186/334 (0.56x)
Testing collisions (low  12-bit) - Expected    2396744.0, actual 2392648 (1.00x) (-4096)
Testing collisions (low   8-bit) - Expected    2396744.0, actual 2396488 (1.00x) (-256)
Testing distribution - Worst bias is the 18-bit window at bit 20 - 0.071%
