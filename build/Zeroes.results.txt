Keyset 'Zeroes' - 204800 keys
Testing collisions ( 64-bit) - Expected    0.0, actual      0 (0.00x)
Testing collisions (high 32-bit) - Expected          9.8, actual      5 (0.51x)
Testing collisions (high 21-30 bits) - Worst is 29 bits: 45/78 (0.58x)
Testing collisions (high 12-bit) - Expected     204800.0, actual 200704 (0.98x)
Testing collisions (high  8-bit) - Expected     204800.0, actual 204544 (1.00x) (-256)
Testing collisions (low  32-bit) - Expected          9.8, actual      8 (0.82x)
Testing collisions (low  21-30 bits) - Worst is 30 bits: 26/39 (0.67x)
Testing collisions (low  12-bit) - Expected     204800.0, actual 200704 (0.98x)
