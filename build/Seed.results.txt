[[[ Keyset 'Seed' Tests ]]]

Keyset 'Seed' - 5000000 keys
Testing collisions ( 64-bit) - Expected    0.0, actual      0 (0.00x)
Testing collisions (high 32-bit) - Expected       5820.8, actual   2929 (0.50x)
Testing collisions (high 26-40 bits) - Worst is 36 bits: 195/363 (0.54x)
Testing collisions (high 12-bit) - Expected    5000000.0, actual 4995904 (1.00x) (-4096)
Testing collisions (high  8-bit) - Expected    5000000.0, actual 4999744 (1.00x) (-256)
Testing collisions (low  32-bit) - Expected       5820.8, actual   2920 (0.50x)
Testing collisions (low  26-40 bits) - Worst is 40 bits: 13/22 (0.57x)
Testing collisions (low  12-bit) - Expected    5000000.0, actual 4995904 (1.00x) (-4096)
