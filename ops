Passing SMHasher doesn't guarantee that your hash is strong, you need also to understand how to change smhasher to make your hash fail. Your idea that users should understand CRC math and research each hash they are using yourself, is absolutely laughable - real users are much less educated even than you. And finally, idea to mix weak crc hash with reasonable main t1ha hash with automatic hash selection based solely on speed, deceives these users by pretending them that they are using reasomnnable main hash while automatic selection actually chooses crc hash in most cases. You are started with good idea, but then lost sense trying to setup meaningless records and relying on automatic smhasher testing rather than understanding of your own algorithms.","files":null}]}
