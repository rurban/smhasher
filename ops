Sorry to bother you again, but could you re-run the tests with the latest version? Most importantly, the speed tests. It's still called `prvhash42`, because it's only a rearrangement of the same core function. https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash I've discovered this function actually generates pseudo-entropy continuously, shifting from one unrelated state to another, on each entropy injection, so there is no need in N*m operations.\n\nYou won't believe it, but now the function creates hashes of any length in O(message_len) time. If possible, please also run 160- and 256-bit function tests, for completeness sake - if your test suite supports such bit lengths.","files":null}]}
