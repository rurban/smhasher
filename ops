Q: Are you sure? (\"secure quality crypto hash functions are actually statistically extremely weak\")","message":"The probability of such errors is quite small, and if such flaws really exist, then all these functions cannot be recognized as cryptographically strong. So either you've found a way to attack all modern cryptography, or there's a trivial bug in smasher.\n\nI will definitely check the code, but (unfortunately) I will not be able to do it until the weekend.","files":null}]}
