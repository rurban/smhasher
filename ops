I would like to commnet that even MomentChi2=4.2 does not mean bad but means marginal good. That is a p-value of ~0.03, which can naturally occur sometimes due to pure randomness. SHA256 show similar marginal behavir as you benchmarks ~100 hash functions (multiple testing). A MomentChi2\u003e10 means definitely bad.\nAlso, recently wyhash have been updated, so this value change with version.\nthe take-home message is that wyhash/wyhash32low are both HIGH quality hashes.","files":null}]}
