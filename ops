Is that correct?\nI have to admit I not sure I understand the Moment Chi2, but I wanted to research it further since it was noted as a quality problem with wyhash32low.  But in examining the file, it appears to really be a misprint.  \n\nDoes that mean the wyhash32low does not have a quality problem and is safe to use as a 32 bit hash?\n\nThanks","files":null}]}
