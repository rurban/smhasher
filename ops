Is there a bug or\n\u003e you are sure of the results? if so, we should improve the hash function.\n\u003e\nNo, there's certainly a bug in the collision counting in the new Words\ntest. Working on it. I've crosschecked with sort | uniq -c and it's wrong.\nThe hash functions are fine.\nThere are also more minor bugs in the tests lurking.\n\nI also improved the collision estimation calc, which detoriated with large\nnumbers. Now it looks much better. The good hashes are now all perfect as\nthey should be.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ea8195bf30d85b36cadb8f08e79aa22a50e04d9a05d6d973c74da1c9f099555e"},"timestamp":1597852491,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjUxMTA4OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/137#issuecomment-676511088"},"nonce":"QSGvcBMz9YFEH3qaTyS9zdfO+78=","message":"Found my Words bug.
