I have a hash that's very similar to a reduced-bit-size version of wyhash ([WaterHash](https://github.com/tommyettinger/smhasher-with-junk/blob/master/seed_check/waterhash.h#L40-L43)) and another that's a little different, but still somewhat mum-type ([WootHash](https://github.com/tommyettinger/smhasher-with-junk/blob/master/seed_check/woothash.h#L50-L53)). I'm pretty sure the first of these has bad seeds, but I'm not sure how to send billions of possible seeds (like all with 0 in the lower 32 bits) to BadSeeds to check. The second of these might not qualify as \"blind\" multiplication, so it could be resistant or immune to this issue -- or it might not, so it would be great to be able to scan for problematic seeds.","files":null}]}
