The BadSeeds test make use of hasher's default internal secrets. It is like: \"I use (public) password of your public account and I found you have only 100 dollars left and I announce that to the media saying you are a poor man\". The fact is that I have 2^32 \"accounts\" each of which has 100 dollars :-D\nBut I don't want to involve too much to the this problem as wyhash is almost complete and there are more important things to do. So usually I keep calm and satisfied with the nominal \"second place\" in the speed list :-D\nTo your problem this WYHASH_CONDOM protects for entropy loss but not password lost.","files":null}]}
