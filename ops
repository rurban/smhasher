It's now optimal on shorter strings, raw speed is 2% higher, a bit smaller code. Passes all tests, including 256-bit tests from some older SMHasher version which still supported 256-bit hashes. I think it's now complete, except the default seed values can be tailored better for SMHasher, but I think this is not needed - MomentChi is not perfect, Avalanche could show better biases. https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash","files":null}]}
