OTOH, I think that it'd be more constructive to balance out the sensationalism by mentioning the fact that MANY (most?) practical hash tables have restrictions on key size (e.g. 32 bytes) AND encoding (e.g. ascii), such that crypto/stronger hash functions like SipHash are indeed PRACTICALLY flood resistant (not really proof) to known attacks? The same cannot be said for most \"weaker\" hash functions.","files":null}]}
