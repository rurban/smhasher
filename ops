Right now wyhash processes (\"mixes\") message bi-directionally (from start, and from end). While it does work as it is, passes SMHasher tests, its structure \"breaks\" on Permutation tests if the message is processed sequentially. As I'm developing PRVHASH myself, I've found similarities with wyhash - the functions are quite different, but have similar issues. This is the main reason I'm unable to increase its performance by a factor of 2 - this would require bi-directional processing, which makes streamed hashing impossible. (I'm not quite sure what's the purpose of high-speed hash function if it can't hash files in a streamed mode - I do not think anyone is going to keep multi-gigabyte files in memory).","files":null}]}
