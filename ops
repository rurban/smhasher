But be aware that I cannot vouch for it’s stability. It is very new, and while integrating it the author still had to fix a few kinks to get it working in my benchmark. If that does not bother you, it’s search performance is very fast.\n\u003e\n\u003eIf you want a more stable map with very good performance, I’d go for `absl::flat_hash_map` as the default map. It is very stable, has lots of features, and definitely well tested.","files":null}]}
