PRNG is beyond expectations, its period scales with the number of hash words almost exponentially (so, each 32-bit hash word in the system increases period exponent by about 32). And more importantly, multiplications by zero are now structurally impossible, so the PRNG does not lose entropy at all.\n\nIn comparsion to version 2.22, the Hash buffer now should not have twice the hash size. Works like before that version, fully \"inplace\". `prvhash42( (const uint8_t*) key, len, (uint8_t*) out, 8, seed, 0 );`\n\nhttps://github.com/avaneev/prvhash","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"656dd67b0f9bdf8bc451c83ff8f36ef959de2c8b4781d218d9958f9e71ef0639"},"timestamp":1600972034,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODUxMTc4Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/166#issuecomment-698511782"},"nonce":"9irIGckwYUw9+JIxtB9IkdwYtHs=","message":"Enormous amount of work and experimentation.
