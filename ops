It's twice as fast as prvhash42, the only drawback is it's not very portable and not very good for short messages (bad biases for 16-bit sparse and combinations). Otherwise it shows exponentially better bit biases in most tests. Maybe you could add prvhash82_64 and prvhash82_128 tests? https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash","files":null}]}
