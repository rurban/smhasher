No more, no less. \n\nNot only do many keyed hash functions accept more than 32 bits worth of key, the BadSeeds test seems to assume that seeds are 64 bits, and thus the test ends up testing what effectively is the same 32-bit seed domain repeatedly. \n\nOn a related note, there should be some way for a hash function to specify that it doesn't use a seed, so that seeding-based tests can be skipped for that hash function.","files":null},{"type":2,"timestamp":1649508917,"metadata":{"github-id":"RTE_lADOARWYbc5HcNc2zwAAAAF9jahE"},"nonce":"g462xZ9MM0foBc/2Fmj8jKKNv3M=","title":"Seeds larger than 32 bits","was":"BadSeeds test performs redundant checking of seeds"}]}
