Reading data past a buffer is known to sometimes work due to overallocation strategies on many systems.\n\nThe problem is, that both behavior are unpredictable, non-standardized, and not guaranteed (not even on those systems in the situation when it worked once, after some time or update or whatever it'll stop working or even do some harm).\n\nSo I think it's a nice non-default property of a hash function to gain speed, but I don't think it's wise to make it a default for cross-platform hash function.\n\nCurious what @erthink will say.","files":null}]}
