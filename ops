I've been using smhasher to compare/contrast hashes, and I came across some modifications that lead to more consistent behavior (no more fractional cycles/hash, unless hashes are weird like that, and/or CPU scaling is in effect). I have also been adding more output column data for the small key speed tests.\n\nReally, I just wanted to know if you were interested in PRs to provide more output information (possibly with a command line option), more consistent timings, fixes for compilation on some Ubuntu Linux variants. Speaking of which, some of my changes may take some testing on your end of things, and hopefully I can get it working with your existing test suite.\n\nHave a great rest of your weekend.","files":null}]}
