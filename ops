E.g. I had two variants of hashing code that showed 0.71% average, but while one gave 1.5 MomentChi2, another gave 6.0 MomentChi2... So, I would add \"standard deviation\" of these max bias measurements as well - this factor also differentiates hashing algorithm. I think it's not bad to have a high average if std.dev is lower.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1674064440,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADOARWYbc4_yulhzwAAAAHsO9j7"},"nonce":"gLt5Cn4oIuIUlXV/48FxSbnS6tQ=","status":2}]}
