At least at the time, it was faster than a switch statement, which is why I ended up using it instead of a switch and two-three other things I tried. I vaguely remember the resulting assembly avoiding an unnecessary pipeline stall, but it's been 3 years. My point was that clobbering other people's work without discussion is a bit strange, especially with a commit that says 'msvc fixes'. If you'd done it, I couldn't complain - it's your project, but when another contributor does it without asking.. Since you've now said you're in favour, I consider the issue closed.
