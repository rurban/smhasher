Benchmarks on this GitHub page show that MurmurHash3 runs at over 3000 MB/s, while my implementation can only reach 40 MB/s. When I did some calculations, my number seems reasonable given that a 3GHz processor can only run 3*10^9 cycles per second, which translates to roughly 60 MB/s assuming that each hash takes around 50 cycles (as stated on the GitHub page). **How are hash functions able to achieve such high speeds? Are there any compiler optimizations that could be contributing to this performance?**\n\n2. In my tests, I have found that MurmurHash3 is significantly slower than FNV1a (40MB/s vs 80MB/s). However, according to the benchmarks, MurmurHash is 4 times as fast as FNV. How is this the case, as it appears that MurmurHash3 have lengthier code and more instructions than FNV1a. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if someone could answer my questions!","files":null}]}
