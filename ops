Based on the read-through method from FNV1A_Pippip_Yurii, wyhash practical performance have been enhanced significantly. Now, @Sanmayce you can use wyhash as superfast string hashing method. Based on my practical test (hashing /usr/share/dict/american-english), it is faster than XXH3, as same speed with FNV1A_Pippip_Yurii, but passed SMHasher tests.","files":null}]}
