Having looked at the tests in @demerphq SMhasher, it is clear that metrohash-c itself is somehow different from metrohash-cpp and has additional quality problems. Therefore, my optimization has them as well. Recently added hashes like mum and @leo-yuriev 's t1ha appear to have both better quality and better/similar performance respectively. I'll need to test them more thoroughly and in-situ with real-world data, but the chances are either one or both obsolete metrohash for my use case.","files":null}]}
