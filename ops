But fail on a test means it is not good. That is why we need a set of tests on hashes from different angles. doningnothing passed momentschi, but will fail on other tests. if it passes all tests, we have to admit that till now we can not break it. \nThe momentchi has two passes, one for the key and one for the seed. Finally we compare them. However, the result of two passes can be compared to a absolute values assuming hash produces uniform distributed random numbers. When comparing to absoulte expectations, we can known if key is weak or seed is weak. Because my math is weak, I uses key-vs-seed trick to let one fight with himself in the mirror.","files":null}]}
