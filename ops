But it still produces collisions\n\u003e at random, like any other test.\n\u003e\n\u003e If you want to see the statistics in action, you could try running the\n\u003e specific test (Sparse 16-bit keys) on Beamsplitter a thousand times using a\n\u003e thousand different seeds.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you commented.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/114#issuecomment-607650708\u003e,\n\u003e or unsubscribe\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFJZFG6M6REEUFA4XCM546DRKQW6DANCNFSM4LRLMSZQ\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e","files":null}]}
