Those SSE functions are very HW dependent.\nI think circumstances (CPU, compiler version, optimization flags) of the testing should be noted in the results.\n\nHowever, the results falkhash look suspicious. \nMore over:\n -  Currently first (weak) version on falkhash is included.\n    In general this version have problems with tests like sparse-bits.\n    I think these problems are not detected in SMHasher only because falkhash uses the 0x50 block size, e.g. not a power of 2.\n - The fixed (second) version of falkhash expected to be significantly slower.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\u003e The abbrevated versions of MD5 and SHA1 are indeed doing horribly, means their lower 32bits are not worth using.
