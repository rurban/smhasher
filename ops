It would be useful to collision-test hash function against a common application: password storage.\nE.g. on generated list of 300000 random 6-16-character passwords from the set ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789.,!?:;-+=()\u003c\u003e/\\|\"'@#$%\u0026*_^`{}[]\nThis is what password generators usually produce. The mix of different-length passwords is an important part of the test.\n\nSecond test is a collision test on a vocabulary of English words, at least 200000 required.","files":null}]}
