But there's more: I've just released `prvhash82` function - it is the same algorithm, but extended to 128-bit math, produces hashes in 64-bit length increments. It's twice as fast as prvhash42, the only drawback is it's not very portable and not very good for short messages. Otherwise it shows exponentially better bit biases in most tests. Maybe you could add `prvhash82_64` and `prvhash82_128` tests?","files":null}]}
