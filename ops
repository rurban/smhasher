This seems to be an obvious thing, but many users do not know about it and have no idea about the possible consequences.\n\nThis looks to me to be a rather serious drawback, despite the low probability, since some of the data does not affect the hash value at all (e.g. _wyhash_ case).\n\nI think we need to come up with some kind of test that would allow us to clearly identify such flaws.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"9556b3528bb71e828da55722f4a91f25e84fafcbbdb4e86feb42a2d9eac4693e"},"timestamp":1580916437,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjQ2MTgwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/99#issuecomment-582461806"},"nonce":"nonKqVR8DLB9O4mGue1gjLIZshA=","message":"@wangyi-fudan, FYI.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"9556b3528bb71e828da55722f4a91f25e84fafcbbdb4e86feb42a2d9eac4693e"},"timestamp":1580916744,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjQ2NDM0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/99#issuecomment-582464340"},"nonce":"j9/00iGUGzUcVncJ+FA2VXs+Y2k=","message":"@gzm55, FYI","files":null}]}
