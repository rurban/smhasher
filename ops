The measurement results are misleading for many practical use cases, esp. we'd need to test more common keys, and the I-cache effects. Used in hashtables, FNV or other simple mult. hashes are far better than the big and good hash functions. They should only be used in databased or file digests. I don't use wyhash or t1ha0, rather the simpliest FNV1. java similar.\nE.g. Spooky is esp. good avoiding collisions with common keys. But that's already described in the docs. I thought about adding a better practical test, and the codesize.\n\nBeing bad means that it fails all of the smhasher tests. Esp. the security relevant ones.","files":null}]}
