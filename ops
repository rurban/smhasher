I have emailed you a few times in the past, but only received a brief response once. I see you are more active on this project these days, so I am reaching out to you here.\n\nPreviously, I have noticed some serious bugs and some other areas that I thought were worth fixing up in smhasher. I put together a preliminary set of patches for you at https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher-rurban-fork/-/commits/fwojcik-fixes-bundled-public. They are still available, although the baseline is a bit outdated. I could rebase them on a later master if you need. As I said before, I **really** hate using Github or I'd have just done PRs here.\n\nHowever, I ended up just fixing and changing more and more things, and I've ended up with my own fork of smhasher. While there is a copy on Github for convenience, the main site is on Gitlab. If you would please add a link to SMHasher3 at https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3 in the README here, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!","files":null}]}
