In commit https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/commit/00a4e5ab6bfb7b25bd3c7cf915f68984d4910cfd, a hash was added but the quality problems column does not appear to have been copied correctly.\n\nThe hashes affected are:\n- `City32` vs `City64`: The former has no issues in the log but is noted to have 2 minor collisions, whereas the latter has no problems noted but has 2 collisions in its log ([here](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/City64#L125-L131)).\n- `Spooky128` vs `xxHash32`: The former has no issues in the log but is noted to have collisions with 4-bit differentials ([here](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/Spooky128#L60-L62)), whereas the latter has no problems noted but has a collision with 4-bit differentials ([here](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/xxHash32#L60-L62)).\n- `metrohash128_2` vs `metrohash64crc_1` and `metrohash64crc_2`: The first has no collisions in its log but is noted to have cyclic collisions with 8 byte (which is not even checked in the log, see [here](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/metrohash128_2#L88-L108)), whereas the second metrohash64 is noted to have no problems but  also has cyclic collisions with 8 byte [here](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/metrohash64crc_1#L90-L92).","files":null}]}
