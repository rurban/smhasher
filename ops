So, existing PRVHASH42 variants can be removed - the new PRVHASH64/PRVHASH64S function replaces them all. 32-bit hashing is now unavailable. Speed was also further increased for PRVHASH64S.\n\nPRNG is now twice as fast. I think security remained the same overall.\n\n@rurban Please send me your PayPal address to aleksey.vaneev@gmail.com - I would like to make a direct donation to you.\n\nhttps://github.com/avaneev/prvhash","files":null}]}
