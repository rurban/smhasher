Using a list of random len strings is not much different than testing most len's seperately.\nBut it would be faster to test much less, of course, with a single long list of random-len strings. Thinking about it.\n\nMore important is to find out why some quality hashes fail this test now: \nProbably still wrong estimation calc with a very low number of colls (~4 colls on 32bit), loosing a lot of accuracy in the pow().","files":null}]}
