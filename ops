Other tests seem to use a fixed seed value of 0, so they complete normally.\n\nI think at least the \"Speed\" test could benefit from separating the seeding phase from the actual hashing. Additionally, it would be great to have a way to specify other seed values than 0 for the other tests.\n\n\u003e Do you need to process the IV after each seed change that expensively?\n\nIt's expensive because each seed value is generating and compiling a brand new compression function.","files":null}]}
