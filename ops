On my notebook (i7-4600U) pre-seeded StadtX show near the same performance as xxHash and t1ha2_atonce (results are [here](https://github.com/leo-yuriev/t1ha/tree/devel#benchmarking-and-testing)).\n\nHowever, it seems to me that the [update step in t1ha2](https://github.com/leo-yuriev/t1ha/blob/devel/src/t1ha2.c#L60-L74 ) is stronger than [ones it StadtX](\nhttps://github.com/demerphq/BeagleHash/blob/master/stadtx_hash.h#L227-L234). Primarily in t1ha I provided two injections point for each word of data. I would like to hear your opinion.","files":null}]}
