Refactor cmake scripts to avoid checks and any if's for 32/64 and release/debug. This is required to support Ninja and othe multi-configuration generators.\n2. Avoid use features specific to gcc or provide extra marcos (line inside t1ha).\n3. Replase all \"#if __x86_64__\" to \"#if UINTPTR_MAX \u003e 0xffffFFFFul || ULONG_MAX \u003e 0xffffFFFFul\" or \"if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__x86_64)...\" like https://github.com/leo-yuriev/t1ha/blob/40f1cc26ed2c3cf82e6bec8804e834fa9245ed26/t1ha.h#L221-L238\n\nSo, this is a huge refactoring with a lot of changes (that I plan do this in https://github.com/leo-yuriev/HashContest).","files":null}]}
