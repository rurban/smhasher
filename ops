Each of those pair ideally have a 2^-32 chance of colliding, so you get 1282331403 * 2^-32 = 0.298566 expected collisions. Calculating the [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) for that expectation gives a chance of 0.741881 for 0 occurrences, 0.221501 for 1 occurrence, and thus 0.036618 for two or more occurrences. Two such tests are performed, that gives a combined probability of at least one of them failing of 0.071895.","files":null}]}
