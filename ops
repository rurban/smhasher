At least we can say that wyhash has paid attention to security.\n\nV2=\u003eV3  2X bulk hash speed improvement with the same security level with V2:\n\nThe speed benchmark is as follow (on a new very fast Xeon Gold CPU):\n\n|key size | wyhash | XXH_SCALAR|XXH_SSE2|XXH3_AVX2 | t1ha2_atonce |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n|bulk:bytes/cycle|9.888 | 3.173| 9.931|15.500|7.872|\n|small:cycles/hash|13.070 |18.293 |18.304|18.242|25.830|\n\nHope you like it.\nYours,\nYi","files":null}]}
