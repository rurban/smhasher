It uses a different `domain separation bit flags` (called `d` in the Blake3 spec). It is `KEYED_HASH` or 0b0001_0000 defined in `blake3_impl.h`.\n\nThe default mode uses 0 for the flag, and there is also a `DERIVE_KEY` mode which uses different flags.\n\nI don't think it should matter for this use case, just wanted to point it out for completeness.","files":null}]}
