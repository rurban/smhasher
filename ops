Moreover, the later a zero rolls, (then) the greater the losses will be. For example, if a zero rolls at the end of the main loop, then the 1/4 of the data will be lost.\n\nFor many applications, this is an unacceptable flaw. Therefore, users should know about the price of speed, in order to make their own conclusions and assess the risks (regardless of how you assess the severity of the problem).\n\n---\n\nNow _SMHasher_ includes a table listing many drawbacks of hash functions, and many developers use this information to select hash functions. Therefore, it is irresponsible to keep silent about an aspect, especially if it is simple enough to explain it.\n\nIn addition, most (seem with single exception) hash function designers consider it unacceptable to intentionally leave a such known flaws (especially when ones are obviously).","files":null}]}
