Thank you for your help in the past. Good to see your maintenance and extension of smhasher has contributed a lot of good stuff!\n\nI had a question regarding two older hashes I submitted:\n\n[tifuhash](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/59f2ee39c7ceeae8106a59fbda5650c849d9e535/tifuhash.cpp) [results - no FAIL but rated POOR](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/59f2ee39c7ceeae8106a59fbda5650c849d9e535/doc/tifuhash_64.txt), and\n- [floppsyhash}(https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/59f2ee39c7ceeae8106a59fbda5650c849d9e535/floppsyhash.cpp) [results - many FAIL but rated GOOD](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/floppsyhash.txt)\n\n\nyou've probably told me the reason for this before and I've just forgotten, but would it be a bad idea for you to tell me why the results with no fail say GOOD, but the results with many fail so POOR?","files":null}]}
