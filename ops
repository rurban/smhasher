These are mostly expected speed results (I get 4GB/s for PRVHASH64 on Skylake with 4.7GHz boost). However, previous version (42) of PRVHASH performed better in your tests, which is strange. It did not perform as fast on my machines considering you have only 3.1 GHz boost Intel i5-2300. In some tests your computer showed even 8.7GB/s for PRVHASH42S and 3.7GHz for PRVHASH42 previously, which should not be possible at all.\n\nLike I've mentioned before, I think there's some strangeness in your raw speed tests, sorry.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"656dd67b0f9bdf8bc451c83ff8f36ef959de2c8b4781d218d9958f9e71ef0639"},"timestamp":1611230421,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NDU5NTcyOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/179#issuecomment-764595728"},"nonce":"ocnHKwWoN+3vvuA5bxkR1DpwClk=","message":"Also, in your tests on Mac Air i7-4650, both PRVHASH64 and PRVHASH64S have similar speed, which I see as impossibility - PRVHASH64S should be at least 1.5-2 times faster due to much lower overhead.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"656dd67b0f9bdf8bc451c83ff8f36ef959de2c8b4781d218d9958f9e71ef0639"},"timestamp":1611230668,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NDU5NzgwMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/179#issuecomment-764597801"},"nonce":"1NXMA0Cv0Weu6slYes59NtcoNNA=","message":"Only your Zen results are in tune with what I usually get, maybe some issues with non-AMD timing functions.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"656dd67b0f9bdf8bc451c83ff8f36ef959de2c8b4781d218d9958f9e71ef0639"},"timestamp":1611230988,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NDYwMDQ3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/issues/179#issuecomment-764600474"},"nonce":"FyYHID0bBg0zurxewIrvS0ss4v8=","message":"@rurban Ah, I've noticed an issue with speed numbers you've put into table.
