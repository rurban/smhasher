This is a very extreme test.\n\nIt can run for e.g. 10000 iterations.\n\nOn each iteration a zero message is generated with a random length (Len) of 1000-30000 bytes.\nAfter zero message buffer is created, 100-300 (also random count) bits are set in it. Position of each random bit is chosen randomly in the range 0..(Len*8-1).","files":null}]}
