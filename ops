I appreciate it.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for not being clearer. While SMHasher3 is GPL'd, I submitted all of those patches under the MIT license with the goal of having them in your distro. This was all done _long_ before I'd thought about running my own fork. I had been strenuously avoiding Github, which I've now (very sadly) started to work with again for other reasons. So I will shortly create PRs for most of the issues in that repo of fixes. If you don't want any or all of them, that's totally fine; you can just close the PRs and I'll drop it.","files":null}]}
