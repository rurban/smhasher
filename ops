It's the smallest high-quality hash function with good security in existence I think. It passes 32..512 bit SMHasher tests (like other PRVHASH variants), but I think it should be only used for 32-bit hashes. Please include it to your test suite.\n\nhttps://github.com/avaneev/prvhash","files":null}]}
