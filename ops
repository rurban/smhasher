It's really changed a lot in the last 3 years, all because of the effort you put in. The project's so much bigger than it was before, and better, thanks to your effort. I, and I'm sure a lot of others, really appreciate what you're doing.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure you're super busy so I get if you can't get to this, or if anything makes it impossible for you and that's cool, everyone's got different degrees of freedom there, but I was just wondering about something and I have a pretty stupid question so I'm sorry.\n\nQuestion is: how do I reproduce the \"UB\" claims you make against some of the hashes? Specifically I'm trying to repro on my hashes discohash and beamsplitter so I can try to address the UB flags you put against them. I tried,\n\n```console\n$ clang++ -fsanitize=undefined *.cpp\n```\non my discohash repo and it compiled fine. Sorry I'm not an expert in this and I know it's not your job, so if you can't reply that's cool. I'm just wondering, how do I do it like you did it so I can reproduce the behaviour you're seeing?\n\nAnyway, I get if you're too busy to reply or if anything else means you can't get to this and that's cool, everyone has different degrees of freedom there,  I wish you all the best in SMHasher and have a great 2021!\n\nCris","files":null}]}
