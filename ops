It wasn’t until I started playing around with GPU PRNGs that I realized the difference: PRNGs are designed for going deep, and hashes for going wide.\n\nCould we construct a test showing how \"wide\" the hash goes? Such test could also be named \"how prone the hash is to create correlation patterns\".\n\nIt's probably not that much important for hash quality in general, but maybe it might find some important use in the future once it'll be measured :wink:.","files":null}]}
