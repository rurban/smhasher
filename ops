Take each byte of each resulting hash, and increment a counter in 1. based on the byte value.\n3. Normalize the counts by dividing by the average count.\n4. Evaluate the resulting standard deviation. It should be in some predefined \"safe\" range: e.g. 0.001-0.003. Too low values are unnatural (e.g. LCG-like randomness) while too high values signal non-uniformity.","files":null}]}
