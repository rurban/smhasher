I'm not sure if these issues I'm having are staring me right in the face but unfortunately I can't figure it out.  Essentially, I added 3 header files and a C file.  I assumed all I needed to do was add the blake2s.c into the cmakelists.txt add_library() function but that doesn't seem to help.  Can anyone give me a hand here?  I'd really appreciate it.  \n\nThanks!\nMatt","files":null}]}
