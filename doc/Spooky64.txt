Testing collisions (high 32-bit) - Expected        511.9, actual    522 (1.02x) (11)
Testing collisions (high 24-36 bits) - Worst is 36 bits: 39/31 (1.22x)
Testing collisions (low  32-bit) - Expected        511.9, actual    556 (1.09x) (45)
Testing collisions (low  24-36 bits) - Worst is 36 bits: 43/31 (1.34x)
Testing distribution - Worst bias is the 18-bit window at bit 30 - 0.104%
